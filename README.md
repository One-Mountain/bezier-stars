# bezier-stars
Two python codes are in this file. 
The python code bezie follows the creation of cubic bezier curves by coding train video on bezier curves: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enNfb6p3j_g&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain

A couple of modifications were made to use it on python code and have the first control point be controlled by mouse movement. 

The second file called bezie star uses those functions in the creation of quadratic bezier stars. 
python code accepts user inputs to determine the number of points for a star and outputs the bezier curve.
